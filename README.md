# EmployeeManagementPortal

This WebApplication is for internal working of a company, and the project is still not completed, it's in progress, we are adding new
features to the project.

If you want to use this code, then please make sure you enter your database details in the persistence.xml file. 

The path of persistence.xml is [EmployeePortal->src/main->resources->META-INF->persistence.xml]

Then you should also implement three tables in the database Admin Table, Employee Table and Employee Salary Table. Please check the entity classes [EmployeePortal->src/main->java/com/learn/employee/portal->entity] of this tables in the projects to know about the columns of each table.
After that mention your table names and columns names in the entity class.

These are the mandatory changes which you have to make to run our project.

Thank You.
